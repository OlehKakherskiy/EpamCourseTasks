Ever since the release of Java 5, I've been keeping my eyes open for a book that describes what I believe to be the most
powerful new feature of Java - generics !?? As a bonus, the second half of this book. The new book published by O'Reilly, Java Generics and Collections covers the topic in spades...
Examines the Java Collections Framework todoA? Since the Collections Framework was rewritten to incorporate the use of
generics, it makes perfect sense for the authors to spend a reasonable amount of time describing the new interfaces!
